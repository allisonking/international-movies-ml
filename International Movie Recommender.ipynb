    "# Recommending movies from around the world!\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "One of the potential dangers in recommender systems is also what they are meant to do- recommend you things that you will continue to like. This can lead people to continue liking things they already like with nothing that would inspire them to try something out of their comfort zone. Branching out can lead to diversity in thinking as well as increased empathy. Therefore, the goal of this project is to deliberately use a user's preference to recommend them movies from another country. The user will be able to choose a country, then the recommender will use their preferences to recommend a movie for them from that country. This project was partly inspired by [Book Riot's list of 80 books from the 80 most populated countries in the world](http://bookriot.com/2016/04/28/around-world-80-books-global-reading-list/ \"book riot list\").\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting the data we need\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll begin by importing some data. We're going to use the [Movielens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) dataset, a dataset of user ratings of movies collected by GroupLens Research at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota. \n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset comes with the following files:\n",
    "* `links.csv`: a list of movie ids, along with their IMDB ids. \n",
    "* `movies.csv`: a list of movie ids, their title, and their genre\n",
    "* `ratings.csv`: a list of user ids, the movie id of the movie they rated, the rating they gave it, and the timestamp of when they rated the movie\n",
    "* `tags.csv`: a list of user created tags \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, the Movielens data doesn't automatically come with the country associated with each movie. That's okay though- we can write some scripts to grab that data for us. We can do this data gathering using [OMDB](http://www.omdbapi.com/), the Open Movie database, whose API allows us to access IMDB data. Luckily, thanks to `links.csv`, we have the IMDB ids, so accessing the data is easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code snippet below, we can see the first five rows of `links.csv`. We'll be using [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/), a data analysis library, for most of our data manipulation... at first."
