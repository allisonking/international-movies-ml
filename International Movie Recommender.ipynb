    "# Recommending movies from around the world!\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "One of the potential dangers in recommender systems is also what they are meant to do- recommend you things that you will continue to like. This can lead people to continue liking things they already like with nothing that would inspire them to try something out of their comfort zone. Branching out can lead to diversity in thinking as well as increased empathy. Therefore, the goal of this project is to deliberately use a user's preference to recommend them movies from another country. The user will be able to choose a country, then the recommender will use their preferences to recommend a movie for them from that country. This project was partly inspired by [Book Riot's list of 80 books from the 80 most populated countries in the world](http://bookriot.com/2016/04/28/around-world-80-books-global-reading-list/ \"book riot list\").\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting the data we need\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll begin by importing some data. We're going to use the [Movielens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) dataset, a dataset of user ratings of movies collected by GroupLens Research at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota. \n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset comes with the following files:\n",
    "* `links.csv`: a list of movie ids, along with their IMDB ids. \n",
    "* `movies.csv`: a list of movie ids, their title, and their genre\n",
    "* `ratings.csv`: a list of user ids, the movie id of the movie they rated, the rating they gave it, and the timestamp of when they rated the movie\n",
    "* `tags.csv`: a list of user created tags \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, the Movielens data doesn't automatically come with the country associated with each movie. That's okay though- we can write some scripts to grab that data for us. We can do this data gathering using [OMDB](http://www.omdbapi.com/), the Open Movie database, whose API allows us to access IMDB data. Luckily, thanks to `links.csv`, we have the IMDB ids, so accessing the data is easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code snippet below, we can see the first five rows of `links.csv`. We'll be using [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/), a data analysis library, for most of our data manipulation... at first."

For example, if one user has rated Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban as a great movie, and another user has rated Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire as a great movie, yet both users didn't rate the other movie, a similarity matrix may not pick up that these two users have similar taste since it wasn't the same movie. A matrix factorization algorithm though could potentially pick up on latent features between the Harry Potters (e.g. fantasy, magic, life changing, etc.), then these two users could be grouped together.\n",

Most of this explanation is adapted from [quuxlabs](http://www.quuxlabs.com/blog/2010/09/matrix-factorization-a-simple-tutorial-and-implementation-in-python/)- I just added some comments to the code to aid my understanding."

    "The `matrix_factorization` method is simply an implementation of the formulas above. I've also plotted the error associated with each step- as you can see, our gradient descent is working since we are always going toward a lower error. Above, I've also printed the original ratings matrix with 0's, the new matrix which is the result of $P \\times Q$, and also a rounded version of the new matrix. The rounded version at least matches with all of the nonzero values of the original matrix, so it seems like our factorization function did a reasonable job."

    "Building this model took a bit of time, even with Movielens's smaller dataset of 100,000. While it was informative to implement the algorithms, I decided to look into other libraries that would be more powerful and efficient and came across [Graphlab](https://turi.com/). Graphlab is particularly good for large data sets that need efficient distributed and parallel algorithms- sounds perfect for our needs! It also makes model creation very easy and on a high level, similar to what you might see from Microsoft Azure but without the UI."
